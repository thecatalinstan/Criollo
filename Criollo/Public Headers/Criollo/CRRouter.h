/**
 `CRRouter` provides Criollo's routing capabilities. It is the base class for
 `CRServer`, `CRRouteController` and `CRViewController`. It is not meant to be
 instantiated directly, but rather it's methods should be called through one of
 the decendant classes mentioned above. Instances of these classes are called 
 **routers**.

 ## Routing
 
 In Criollo, a route consists of an ordered list of `CRRouteBlock` objects,
 associated with path and an HTTP request method. Blocks are added directly to a
 route by calling `add:block:recursive:method:`, one of its overloadds or any of
 the convenience methods provided, such as `get:block:`,
 `post:block:recursive:`, etc.

 *Important:* blocks are executed in the order in which they are added.
 
 The final parameter of a `CRRouteBlock` is a `dispatch_block_t` object that 
 must be called in order to signal the router that the work of the cuurent block
 has finished its job and execution can proceed to the next block.
 
 ### Path specification
 
 When adding a route, paths can be specified in three ways:
 
 - *Fixed string* (ex. `/api`). This will match the string exactly.

 - *Placeholders* (ex. `/posts/:pid`). The next path component after "/posts",
 will be matched and added to `request.query` under the `pid` key.

 - *Regex patterns* (ex. `/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{1,2}/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+`). When the three
 patterns are matched, they are added to `request.query`, under the keys `"0"`,
 `"1"` and `"2"` respectively.
 
 *Important*: Regex patterns are parsed **per path component**.

 The string that is used to define a path is called a **path specification 
 (pathspec)**.
 
 ### Block, Route Controllers and View Controllers
 
 In real-life, the functionality required by a specific route cannot be simply
 implemented by a single block. Not in a readable way anyway. Come in
 `CRRouteController` and `CRViewController`. These two classes are used to
 provide a more apropriate wrapper for routes that share a common logic.
 
 `CRRouteController` and `CRViewController` instances are added to the router by
 calling `add:controller:recursive:method:` and 
 `add:viewController:withNibName:bundle:recursive:method:` or their overloads.

 Both `CRRouteController` and `CRViewController` expose a `CRRouteBlock` as 
 their workhorse.
 
 ### Serving Static Files
 
 `CRRouter` also provides methods for serving files stored in a directory on
 disk (`mount:directoryAtPath:options:`) or for serving a file
 directly at a specific path
 (`mount:fileAtPath:options:fileName:contentType:contentDisposition:`).
