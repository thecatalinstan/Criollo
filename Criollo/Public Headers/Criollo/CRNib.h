/**
 Instances of the `NSNib` class serve as object wrappers, or containers, for the
 HTML content serverd by instances of `CRViewController`. An `CRNib` object
 keeps the contents of a nib file resident in memory, ready for instantiation.

 Criollo follows the same paradign as Cocoa and UIKit with regards to
 view controllers and nibs. The main difference is that Criollo expects
 an HTML document as the nib's contents.
 
 ## A note on Templating
 
 If you prefer to use a templating language to write html, the way to do
 it to compile the file at build time and copy it to the bundle's resource
 directory. [Criollo Web](https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo-Web)
 uses `jade` as its template language for example.
